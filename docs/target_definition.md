# Target Variable Definition

## Target Name:
congestion_level

## Prediction Type:
Classification

## Target Description:
The level of congestion at an EV charging station, defined as discrete classes
(e.g., low, medium, high) based on charger utilization and queue length.

## Prediction Horizon:
Next 30 minutes

## Unit of Prediction:
Per charging station per time slot

## Why This Target Matters:
Predicting congestion in advance allows operators to manage load, redirect vehicles,
optimize charger utilization, and reduce waiting times for EV users.
