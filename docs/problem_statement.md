# Problem Statement

Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is increasing rapidly, putting significant pressure on public and semi-public EV charging infrastructure.
As a result, many charging stations experience unpredictable congestion, leading to long wait times, inefficient charger utilization, and poor user experience for EV drivers.
Current charging infrastructure often relies on static availability information or manual monitoring, which fails to account for dynamic demand patterns, temporal usage variations, and external factors influencing station congestion.
