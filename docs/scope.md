# Project Scope

This document defines the boundaries of the EV Charging Congestion Prediction System, clearly outlining what the system will and will not address.

## In Scope

- Analysis of congestion patterns at public and semi-public EV charging stations
- Use of historical charging session data to understand demand trends
- Consideration of temporal factors such as time of day and day of week

## Out of Scope

- Real-time congestion monitoring or live system integration
- Optimization or control of charging station operations
- Development of user-facing applications or dashboards
