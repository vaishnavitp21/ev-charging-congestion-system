# EV Charging Congestion Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to predict congestion at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using data-driven and machine learning techniques. The system will analyze historical charging patterns, temporal features, and contextual factors to forecast congestion levels and support intelligent charging management.

## Objectives
- Predict congestion levels at EV charging stations
- Analyze temporal and usage patterns
- Enable data-driven decisions for load balancing and scheduling
